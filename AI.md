### Task: Improving README.md

- **AI Tool Used:** ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5)
- **What I Asked:** I provided my existing `README.md` file for the ByteBuddy project and asked for improvements to make it more polished, beginner-friendly, and professional.
- **What AI Did:**
    - Suggested adding new sections: *Features*, *Demo (screenshot placeholder)*, *Development Notes*, *Contributing*, and *License*.
    - Reorganized and reworded setup instructions for better clarity.
    - Proposed improvements to formatting (icons, headings, code blocks).
    - Ensured the README explains GUI-only interaction and Gradle build usage.
- **Observations:**
    - Worked well for restructuring content and suggesting professional conventions commonly seen in open-source projects.
    - AI saved significant time (~1â€“2 hours) compared to manually drafting and refining wording.
    - Needed minor edits afterwards to tailor wording and confirm technical accuracy (e.g., Gradle tasks, project folder paths).
- **Overall Benefit:** Helped produce a more professional and comprehensive README in a fraction of the time.
