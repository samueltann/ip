## 🛠️ Development Notes

- Keep `src/main/java` as the source root.
- All interaction now happens via the **GUI** (CLI `run()` is deprecated).
- A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is included for **CI/CD** – it builds and tests the project on every commit/PR.
- To package a runnable JAR with JavaFX included:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew shadowJar
